# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

Accountability Accounting is interested in offereing a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to their customers.  They have asked for a report that includes all cyrptocurrencies being traded and then grouped to create a classification system for this new investment portfolio.  Since the output is not known unsupervised learning is utilized and the data is grouped using a clustering algorithm.  The data was prepocessed by dropping any null values, removed any columns that will not be used on the clustering algorithm, and filtered for only entries where coins have been mined. Next the processed data dimensions were reduced using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) algorithm and then placed into a new DataFrame.  Third the data was clustered using K-means.  An elbow curve was created to show the best value for K, which was then used to make predictions on the K clusters. Lastly the results were visualized using 3D and 2D scatter plots, along with a table.
